				This seems like a good book explaining things.
I can't meet your financial needs, but I'm reliable and steady.  
If you'd like to meet for coffee, we can see if there's a spark of chemistry

Well, I could do dinner/lunch and 400 every time we meet but I can meet only 2 times 
a month for now.
I want to be very discreet and am not really looking to get into each others personal lives. 
I look at this site as my chance to "sow my oats" haha I should have done it when I was younger.

I can tell you I will be respectful to you and I hope you will do the same to me.

I have not had a relationship in a while, and I am not even sure I want to for a bit.
Not very confident in myself (call it judgement or bad luck) about holding a 
relationship. 

I am trying not to be a catfish but I am a guy so I naturally do stupid things lol
